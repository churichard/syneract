# Syneract

Syneract is a web app that allows you to video chat with your friends and play multiplayer games against them at the same time. The games utilize the Leap Motion to allow you to more interactively play with these games. This app is aimed towards hospital patients who may not be physically able to visit their friends, but still want to be able to play games with them.
